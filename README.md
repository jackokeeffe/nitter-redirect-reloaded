# ![nitter-redirect](images/icon32.png) Nitter Redirect Reloaded

[![Firefox Extension](images/badge-amo.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/nitter-redirect-reloaded/)

A simple browser extension that redirects X (formerly Twitter) requests to [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter), the privacy friendly alternative.

This is a **modified version** of Simon Brazell's [Nitter Redirect](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/nitter-redirect), which had not been updated to support x.com domains. 

This version also updates the [available Nitter instances](https://status.d420.de/), as the majority of the original instances had been taken down. The onion instances have also been removed â€” if you are aware of any active onion instances, please submit an issue or a pull request with the onion addresses.

No unnecessary permissions are required, only listens for and redirects requests made to `x.com`, `www.x.com`, `mobile.x.com`, and nothing else.

Allows for setting custom [Nitter instances](https://status.d420.de/) and toggling redirects on & off.
