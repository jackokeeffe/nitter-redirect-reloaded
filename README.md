A simple browser extension that redirects X (formerly Twitter) requests to [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter), the privacy friendly alternative.

This is a **modified version** of Simon Brazell's [Nitter Redirect](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/nitter-redirect), which had not been updated to support x.com domains.

This is a **modified version** of Simon Brazell's [Nitter Redirect](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/nitter-redirect), which had not been updated to support x.com domains. 


This version also updates the [available Nitter instances](https://status.d420.de/), as the majority of the original instances had been taken down. The onion instances have also been removed â€” if you are aware of any active onion instances, please submit an issue or a pull request with the onion addresses.

No unnecessary permissions are required, only listens for and redirects requests made to `x.com`, `www.x.com`, `mobile.x.com`, and nothing else.

Allows for setting custom [Nitter instances](https://status.d420.de/) and toggling redirects on & off.


## Version 1.1
Version 1.1 is optimized for Manifest V3, but since Firefox does not support background.service_workers, Manifest V2 solutions **MUST** be used in Firefox, hence the separate versions ([Chrome-optimized]() and [Firefox-optimized]()).

This version adds various security updates (across both versions) not integrated in the original extension, including:

- Switching `browser.storage.sync` to `browser.storage.local` to store user preferences.
- Adding a warning for the usage of custom instances outside of the whitelist (whitelist is comprised of approved instances listed [here](https://status.d420.de/)).
- Added strict Content Security Policy.
- Removed depreciated content-serving methods from original.
- Removed console logging.
